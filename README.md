# PacMan

This project animates an image of PacMan to the end of the x-axis of the page, then reverses it to the beginning and repeats.
The animation is created by using JavaScript to dynamically alter the position of the image and alternate between open and
closed mouth images, then checking the page bounds to see if the direction must be reversed.

## Running the project
This repo requires no extra setup to run. Simply clone the repo to your machine and open index.html in your favorite browser

## Future improvements
To improve on this project I would obtain vertical versions of the PacMan image and integrate the y-axis into the project,
having the PacMan run a loop around the outer edges of the page.
